title: What Is Hatch Oregon?
---

Hatch Oregon is an intrastate crowdfunding platform. So, let's break that
down into its component parts:

You're probably familiar with *Crowdfunding* if you've heard of Kickstarter
or IndiGoGo. On platforms like these, projects can request small amounts
of money from lots and lots of people. The project founders reward their
"backers" based on their contribution. In many cases, the project cannot
get off the ground unless it raises a threshold level of money. So, if the
project doesn't raise the requisite amount, then the backers are refunded.

The thing is, these "backers" aren't owners in the project. In fact, they
aren't allowed to be owners. If the project founders decided to offer
equity as a reward level, then they'd suddenly find themselves face to face
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Why? Because in
order to raise capital from actual investors, you need to [file with the
SEC](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072414/how-company-files-sec.asp).
Its a lengthy, and often expensive, process, involving many lawyers' hours.
