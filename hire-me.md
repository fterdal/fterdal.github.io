# Hire Me!

I've got two years of experience as a web developer, specifically
Python/Django, PHP/WordPress, and Javascript/React (I'm also quite
familiar with Linux sysadmin). I'm moving to Chicago at the end of June,
and my current job isn't compatible with remote work. So I'm in the market
for a job!

I'd be happy with remote jobs or jobs based in Chicago. I'd prefer a salaried
position, but I'm willing to consider contracting gigs as well. Similarly,
I'd like a full-time job, but if its part-time and super amazing in other
ways, I'll gladly consider it.

Here are some things that pique my interest:
* investment crowdfunding (my current role is all about this)
* commercial spaceflight (space rules!)
* progressive activism (e.g. voting rights, redistricting, economic justice)
* teaching (I love to teach)
* data science / visualization (not a ton of experience in this, but I'd be an enthusiastic learner)
* APIs (I love building & enhancing APIs)

If your company is hiring, or you know someone who's looking for a developer,
